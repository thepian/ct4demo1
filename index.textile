h2. Restrictions to allow better user interaction

If you have a very generic way of describing the user interface similar to
the one in Webcentric, there is very few rules that can be applied to allow
for gestures. Must gestures must be programmed as special cases adding
to the required development/testing/maintenance.

The CT4 user interface should run on a windowing model where the interface is
divided into predefined areas. These areas have well defined interactions 
and behaviour.

It has been said that good design comes from taking away until just before
it would be too much.

In a similar vein we should be specific about how the interface behaves
and make an implementation that reflects this, but not go so far that we
don't have room for useful variations in the application.
